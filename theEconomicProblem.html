        <h2>The problem of scarcity</h2>
        
        <h3>Finite resources</h3>

        <p>Every country has resources, however, there is a limited number available</p>
        <p>Limited resources are scarce</p>
        <p>These resources are separated in groups known as the 4 factors of production</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li>Land</li>
            <li>Labor</li>
            <li>Capital</li>
            <li>Enterprise</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Unlimited wants</h3>
        
        <p class="note"> Needs are the basic requirements for human survival; without them, humans would cease to exist</p>
        <p class="note">Wants are human desires, they are unlimited or infinite</p>

        <h2>The Economic Problem</h2>

        <p>This occurs because although our wants are infinite our resources (used to produce them) are limited</p>
        <p>Therefore we have to choose how to allocate our scarce resources between different uses</p>
        <p>There are 3 main questions we ask when choosing how allocating resources</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li>What to produce</li>
            <li>How to produce</li>
            <li>For whom to produce for</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>what to produce</h4>
        
        <p>it is important for a country choose as they cannot produce everyone's wants</p>
        
        <h4>How to produce</h4>
        
        <p>The 4 factors of production can be organised differently, even when producing the same product</p>
        
        <h4>For whom to produce for</h4>
        
        <p>Goods have to be shared amongst the population but in what way. Ultimately it is 'who gets what'</p>

    </div>
    
    <div class="part" id="P3">
        <h2>Opportunity Cost</h2>
        
        <p>Once a choice has been made, a sacrifice has also been made. This is called the opportunity cost</p>
        <p class="note">Opportunity cost is the cost of the next best alternative given up when making a choice</p>

        <h2>Production Possibility Curves (PPC)</h2>
        
        <p class="note">Production Possibility Curves show the combination of two good that can be produced if all resources are used up</p>
        <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/67/Production_Possibilities_Frontier_Curve.svg/1200px-Production_Possibilities_Frontier_Curve.svg.png" alt="PPC Curve" width="50%" height="50%">
        
        <p>At point B more guns are produce that butter</p>
        <p>At point C more Butter is produced than gunss</p>
        <p>At point D an equal amount of butter and guns are produced</p>
        <p>For points B,C and D on the curve, we say the resorces are fully employed and the economy is producing the max quantity of goods given its resources</p>
        <p>At point A, although an equal amount of butter and guns are produced all resources are not used up, hense, the point is under the curve</p>
        <p> say some resources are unemployed</p>
        <p>At point X the quantity of butter and guns produce exceeds the limit caused by finite resources, hense, the point is outside the curve and imposible</p>

        <h2>Moving Allong the PPC Curve</h2>
        <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4c/PPF_opportunity_cost.svg/330px-PPF_opportunity_cost.svg.png" alt='PPC Curve showing oppertunity cost' width="50%" height="50%">
        
        <p>If we start at point A and want to increase butter production by 10 units, the opportunity cost is the 5 units of gun we have to sacrifice</p>
        <p>In reality, economies have to choose between capital goods (goods used by firms to make other goods) or consumer good (goods sold to consumers for persobal use)</p>
        <p>Producing more capital goods could allow for an increase is consumer goods in the future</p>
        <p>Producing more consumer goods increases ensure people have enough in the short term</p>

        <h2>Causes of Positive and Negative Economic Growth</h2>
        
        <h3>Positive Economic growth</h3>
        
        <p>Here are some factors that may impact economic growth</p>
        <ul>
            <li>New Technology</li>
            <li>Improved Efficiency</li>
            <li>Education and Training</li>
            <li>New Resources</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h4>New Technology</h4>
        <p>This increases speed and reliability</p>
        
        <h4>Improved Efficiency</h4>
        <p>e.g. Kaizen (continuous improvement) and lean production (using fewer resorces in production)</p>
        <p>means more resources are used up, instead of wasted</p>
        
        <h4>Education and Training</h4>
        <p>An economy's productivity increases as the proportion of eduacated workers increases</p>
        <p>More educated workers can complete more complicated tasks (usually involving analysis,evaluation and critical thinking)</p>
        
        <h4>New Resources</h4>
        <p>e.g. population increase</p>
        <p> more resources more tasks can be done and more products can be produced</p>
        
        <img src="https://www.economicsonline.co.uk/How%20markets%20work%20graphs/Growth.png" width="50%" height="50%">
        
        <p>The PPC curve shifts outward to show economic growth</p>
        <p>At the new curve, you are able to produce more butter and guns</p>
        
        <h3>Negavuve economic growth</h3>
        
        <img src="https://www.economicsonline.co.uk/How%20markets%20work%20graphs/Negative-growth.png" width="50%" height="50%">
        
        <p>Negative economic growth can be caused by:</p>
        <ul>
        <dl>
            <li><dt>Resorce depletion</dt></li>
                <dd >A lack of natural resources</dd>
        <br>
            <li><dt>Emigration for skilled workers</dt></li>
                <dd >When skilled workers leave a country it reduces the productivity of the economy</dd>
        <br>
            <li><dt>Wars/conflicts and natural disasters</dt></li>
                <dd >conflict may destroy major airport or drought may affect crop yeild</dd> 
        </dl>
        </ul>
        <p>This causes the PPC to shift inwards showing a decrease in the maximum possible output</p>
